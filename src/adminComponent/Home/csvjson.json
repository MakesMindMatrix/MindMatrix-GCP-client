    "task_question": "Scenario 8: Biosensors for Disease Diagnosis\nA biomedical startup is developing wearable biosensors to detect diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular conditions. The sensors use nanomaterials to improve sensitivity and can monitor biomarkers in real-time, such as glucose levels or heart rate variability. The challenge lies in ensuring sensor accuracy, durability, and integration with mobile health platforms to provide actionable insights for users.\nInstructions:\nThe following questions encourage you to explore the situation deeply. Choose the option(s) that you think are the most appropriate or plausible. This will help assess your creativity, curiosity, and ability to think innovatively and interactively.\n\nQuestion 1: What is the primary function of biosensors in disease diagnosis?",
